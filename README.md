# Hangar

A place to park your OAuth tokens

## Motivation

OAuth tokens are a pain to manage. Hangar handles a bunch of the pain for you:

- Refreshes access tokens automatically
- Tracks authorized scopes, making incremental grants easy
- Allows sharing access tokens across multiple servers and services without
  risk of clobbering due to token rotation
